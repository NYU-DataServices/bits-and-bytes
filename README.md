# bits-and-bytes

## add to newsletter archive
1. upload pdf to this repo in the [`/newsletters`](https://github.com/NYU-DataServices/bits-and-bytes/tree/main/newsletters) folder. make sure the year is first and month is second, before any additonal text you'd like in the name! this will help with sorting.
2. wait for the site to republish (you can check progress [here](https://github.com/NYU-DataServices/bits-and-bytes/actions)) then go to the site and confirm it's there. that should be it!

## to do
