## add to newsletter archive

1. upload pdf to this repo in the [`/newsletters`](newsletters) folder. make sure the year is first and month is second, before any additonal text you'd like in the name.
2. add the newsletter publish date as the `label` (e.g., `December 2024` format) and `webview` link to the top of the `newsletters` YAML at the top of the [index.html file](src/index.html). This is what users will see/get to click through to on the website.
3. wait for the site to republish (you can check progress [here](https://github.com/NYU-DataServices/bits-and-bytes/actions)) then go to the site and confirm it's there. that should be it!

## local development

1. `npm install`
